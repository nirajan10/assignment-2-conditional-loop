# Assignment 1: C Programming Basics

## Instructions

1. Upload a PDF containing all theory questions (if any) and answers in the docs/ folder
    - You can create a doc and convert it to PDF online.
    - Name pdf as `answer.pdf`
    - Your first line of pdf should be `Name: Firstname-Lastname`. Eg: Name: Nirajan-Thakuri

2. Write code in the corresponding `src/` file for each programming task.

3. Do not change file names â€” tests depend on them.

4. Commit and push your changes to GitHub.

## Questions (Do not use conditionals or looping)

**Q1.** What is the purpose of the main() function in a C program? Explain its significance.

**Q2.** Explain the difference between a variable declaration and a variable initialization in C.

**Q3.** Write a C program to display a personalized greeting message. (Should contain 'hello' or 'welcome' in the message)

**Q4.** What are the different data types available in C? Provide examples of each data type.

**Q5.** Explain the concept of type conversions in C. Provide examples of implicit and explicit type conversions.

**Q6.** Write a C program to calculate the area of a rectangle. Prompt the user to enter the length and width, and display the result.

**Q7.** What is the role of the scanf() function in C? Provide an example of its usage.

**Q8.** Write a C program to convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. Prompt the user for a temperature in Celsius and display the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit. (Formula: fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32)

**Q9.** Input a number representing days and print the equivalent number of weeks and days. (Example: 10 days = 1 week and 3 days)

**Q10.** Write a C program to swap the values of two variables using a temporary variable.

**Q11.** Write a C expression that performs the following operations in a single line: increment a variable by 1, multiply it by 3, and subtract 10.

**Q12.** Given three variables a, b, and c, write an expression that checks if a is greater than b and c is not equal to 0.

**Q13.** Write a C expression that evaluates whether a number is divisible by both 2 and 3 (without using the modulus operator).

**Q14.** Create an expression that swaps the values of two variables x and y without using a temporary variable.

**Q15.** Write an expression that checks if a number is both positive and even.

**Q16.** Given two variables x and y, write an expression that calculates the average of their values.

**Q17.** Create an expression that checks if a given character is an uppercase letter.

**Q18.** Write a C expression that calculates the sum of the squares of three different numbers.

**Q19.** Given three variables a, b, and c, write an expression that checks if a is equal to b and b is not equal to c.

**Q20.** Write an expression that checks if a number is a multiple of either 3 or 5.

**Q21.** Create an expression that swaps the values of three variables x, y, and z in a cyclic order (i.e., x becomes y, y becomes z, and z becomes x).

**Q22.** Write a C expression that calculates the square root of the sum of two numbers, rounded to the nearest integer.

**Q23.** Given a variable num, write an expression that checks if it is a power of 2.

**Q24.** Create an expression that checks if a given number is a perfect square.
